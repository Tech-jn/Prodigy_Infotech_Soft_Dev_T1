<h3>This s a simple game of Guessing the number between 1 to 100</h3>

1. GUI Layout:
A label prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100.
An entry field lets the user input their guess.
A button submits the guess.
A label displays feedback ("Too low", "Too high", or "Correct!").

2. Random Number Generation:
A random number is generated when the program starts or after the user wins.

3. Feedback:
If the guess is incorrect, feedback is shown directly in the GUI (e.g., "Too low!").
When the guess is correct, a pop-up congratulates the user and the game resets.

After winning, the random number and attempts counter reset for a new game.
